I got my Master's degree from <a href="http://cst.buaa.edu.cn/">School of Cyber Science and Technology</a> in <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, under the supervision of A/Prof. Ying Gao. I received my Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>.

My main research interests are **multiparty computation** and **zero-knowledge proof**. I am also interested in threshold cryptography. Now I am looking for a Ph.D. position in cryptography.
